# Matchstick Puzzle – Search Algorithms in AI

This repository presents the development of search algorithms applied to a visual matchstick puzzle, implemented in Python as part of a university project.

## 🧠 Project Objective

To solve a classical visual puzzle involving the movement of matchsticks using different search algorithms, progressing from a basic implementation to a more optimized and modular solution.

## 📁 Structure

- **`phase1_raw_bfs/`**  
  Initial implementation using uninformed search (BFS).  
  Simple procedural structure to demonstrate pathfinding in the puzzle context.

- **`phase2_optimized_search/`**  
  Refactored version with modular Python scripts and improved logic.  
  Focus on better separation of concerns, reusability, and efficiency.

## 🔍 Key Concepts

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Search tree visualization
- State representation and transitions
- Performance improvements through refactoring

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib / Image display
- HTML for report generation

## 📸 Visuals

The project includes GIFs and diagrams showing the state evolution and solution steps of the puzzle.

## 🚧 Limitations

- No graphical interface; interactions and outputs are shown via notebooks and console.
- No interactive input system.
